                        <h4>Mentor-Mentee Match</h4>
                        <p>V-PASS helps connect Vietnamese students who wish to pursue an academic doctoral degree (mentees) with current PhD students (mentors) in the same field. The mentors will provide tailored support and advice for the mentees as they explore their field of interest and apply for grad school.</p>
                        
                        <p>Students are encouraged to join at various stages in their journey, even as early as their first year of college if they have had a clear research direction (broadly defined) that they wish to pursue.</p>
                        
                        <p>Students from smaller or lesser-known colleges are especially encouraged to apply.</p>
                        
                        <p>Mentor-mentee matching process occurs twice a year (tentatively September and February). <br>
                        Mentor sign-up is open year-round.</p>

                        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the application form, prospective mentees are asked to describe where they are in their academic journey and what support they would need if paired with a mentor. Though laying out exact sub-fields of interest is not necessary, mentees are expected to be driven and have a good sense of academic direction. They must provide the broad academic field they wish to pursue a graduate degree in.</li>
                            <li>Mentees are paired with mentors based on their broad field or, if possible, sub-field of interest.</li>
                            <li>The support and mentorship provided by the mentor depends on the needs of the mentee. It could range from early guidance (eg. how to apply to work in a lab, discuss research ideas, etc.) to PhD application support (eg. who should I ask for LOR, what to write in the SOP, etc.).</li>
                            <li>After pairing, each mentor-mentee pair has an orientation meeting to set expectations. After that, mentors and mentees meet however frequently as they agree on, but no less than once a month.</li>
                            <li>Mutual respect is expected of both mentors and mentees during the mentorship.</li>
